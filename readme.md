# Short Lnk

This is a link shortening application built with React and Meteor.

Usage:

One must login to the MongoDB server before being able to create links.  
This uses verification for the email.  This app also verifies the websites
that are submitted for shortening.   Once links have been added to the
users database they are easily shared with the app to anyone.
